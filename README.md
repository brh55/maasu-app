# MASU Leadership Summit 2016 Ionic Application
This application was used for MAASU Leadership Summit @ Northwestern University.

Open-sourcing this repository as a reference for Angular.js / Ionic users. Unfortunately, I didn't completely unit test the code because of time constraints, but fortunately everything went pretty smooth when it went live. This project was also genereated by [Generator-M-Ionic v1.8.0](https://github.com/mwaylabs/generator-m-ionic).

Feel free to download and use the app to test for yourself:
- [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/maasu-leadership-summit/id1174485929?mt=8)
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maasu.lsproject&hl=en)

Enjoy!
